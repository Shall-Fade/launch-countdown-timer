# Launch Countdown Timer

This is a solution to the [Launch countdown timer challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/launch-countdown-timer-with-vue-3-4gkUf8Nb75).

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second
- Bonus: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle (in developing)
